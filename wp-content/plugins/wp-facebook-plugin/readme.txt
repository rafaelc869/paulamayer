WP Facebook offers a number of features surrounding the Facebook OpenGraph, social widgets, and more.

=== Social Plugin Widgets ===
Integrate Facebook’s Social Plugins into your WordPress blog using WP Facebook’s built-in, customizable widgets.

=== Facebook Open Graph Integration ===
With Facebook’s recent release of the new Open Graph, you can now update your fans on Facebook when something on a page they’ve liked has changed! WP Facebook puts your posts, pages, and other types of content on Facebooks Open Graph where they belong!

=== WordPress Account Creation/Login via Facebook ===
Allow users to register on your site by having them log in through Facebook! Make it easy for users to connect to your WordPress blog and allow them to use advanced Facebook-exclusive features like attaching comments when using the “Like” button, showing which of your user’s friends are connected to your website, and allowing them to comment on posts on Facebook!

=== Replace WordPress Comments with Facebook Comments ===
If users are logged in via Facebook, you can choose to replace WordPress comments with Facebook’s Comment System, bringing the discussion to the place where people are actually talking – Facebook! Spark some conversation by taking the convo to your users’ friends and families.

=== Allow Users to Post Comments Directly to Facebook! ===
Using the Like Button widget or Facebook comments widget, users can post comments on your articles and content directly to their stream!

=== Use Shortcodes to Embed Facebook Widgets ===
Want to place a Like button directly in an article? Simply use a shortcode to quickly place the button exactly where you want it! All social plugins have shortcode support enabled.

=== For Developers – Custom Open Graph Hooks ===
Got a custom post type that needs to be registered differently on Facebook’s Open Graph? Simply use a hook for “type” to modify how your post is identified by Facebook’s new API.
